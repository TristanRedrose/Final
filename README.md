#### Description:
Hello CS50.
My name is Ivan PaviÄ‡ from Zagreb, Croatia and this is Spookhouse.
Spookhouse is a web-based text adventure made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The site consists of a simple title header, a spooky background and a box containing the story, a related image, and button-prompts.
Upon entering the site the player is prompted to choose an adventure (currently only 1 and credits) via a button prompt. The player 
then gets to choose which options to take and depending on his choices some paths in the story will either close or new paths will 
become available.
When the player reaches an end screen the main menu button will appear, which will return the player to the beggining screen.
